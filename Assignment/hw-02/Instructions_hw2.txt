PowerPoint Presentation Actions for 'How to Think About Algorithms - Iterative'
1a. FIll out all invriannts, pre and post conditions using "assert".

Use values 17, 37 for hash Code.  eg. hash of video looks like:
public int hashCode() {
int result = 17;
result = 37*result + _title.hashCode();
result = 37*result + _year;
result = 37*result + _director.hashCode();
return result;
}


preconditions: at beginning of every method
postconditionsL: at end of every method
invariants: for every loop

1b.  Pull out the given tests into separate JUnit tests
